(a)Find the summation of the elements of a 2D array.
	
	0	1	2
0	12	5	8
1	6	7	4
2	18	9	2

Input (Declarations and Initializations): int arr[3][3], int sum = 0;

Process: 
1.	Start from the row with row-value r=0.
2.	Start from the column with column-value c= 0.
3.	Add the value of sum with the element in arr[r][c] index.
4.	Store the summation of the add operation in (3) in sum.
5.	Increase the value of c by 1.
6.	Repeat (3), (4) and (5) for all the columns.
7.	Increase the value of r by 1.
8.	Repeat (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) for all the rows.

Output: Print the value of sum.
