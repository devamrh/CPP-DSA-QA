10	15	45	20	25	6	1	100	65	99
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9

sum	386

Input (Declarations and Initializations): int arr[10], int sum = 0.

Process:

1.	Add the value of sum with the element in the index-value 0 of the array.
2.	Store the summation of the addition of (1) in sum.
3.	Increase the value of the index by 1.
4.	Repeat (1), (2) and (3) for all the indexes.
